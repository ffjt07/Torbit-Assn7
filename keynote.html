            <blockquote>
               The creator of the entire Pokémon franchise. In 1989, Tajiri founded Game Freak and is still the CEO.  Game Freak paved the way for
               Tajiri to be exposed to more games and gaming consoles. This eventually led to his inspiration for one of the most successful game 
               franchises in history, Pokémon.
